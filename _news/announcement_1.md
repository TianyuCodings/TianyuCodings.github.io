Excited to announce that two papers are accepted by NeurIPS 2025! 🎉 [**CoLT**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17030) (The Conditional Localization Test for assessing neural posterior estimates) is accepted as a **Spotlight**, and [**Improving Data Efficiency for LLM Reinforcement Fine-tuning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05316) introduces difficulty-targeted online data selection for more efficient LLM alignment. See you in San Diego!
