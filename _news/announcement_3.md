Our new papers [**Denoising Score Distillation (DSD)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07578) and [**Restoration Score Distillation (RSD)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13377) propose a novel way to apply distillation methods on various corrupted data, including Fourier space MRI data. We prove that after distillation, we can further improve generative quality when only having access to corrupted data.
