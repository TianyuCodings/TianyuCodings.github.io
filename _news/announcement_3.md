Our new paper **Enhancing and Accelerating Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solving through
Measurements Optimization**, introduces a novel module that can seamlessly integrate with existing inverse problem solvers. This module not only elevates performance to achieve new state-of-the-art results but also significantly reduces computational requirements, requiring no more than 100 NFEs.
