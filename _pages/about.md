I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, 
supervised by Professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). 
Before joining UT, I obtained my master's degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago, 
where I closely collaborated with [Kevin Bello](https://kevinsbello.github.io/), 
[Bryon Aragam](https://www.bryonaragam.com/), [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/), 
 [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/), 
and supervised by Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/). 
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Fudan University, 
where I spent some of the most memorable moments of my life.


Research Interests: I have broad research interests in statistical machine learning. 
Specifically, my research interests lie in:

- **Generative Models**: diffusion models, model distillation, and controllable image editing.  
- **Reinforcement Learning for LLM**: post-training for **both autoregressive (AR)** and **diffusion language models (dLLMs)**, focusing on reasoning enhancement and algorithm design.  
- **Agentic AI** – constructing autonomous agents for data generation and multi-turn evaluation.  
- **Statistical Sampling & Inference** – neural posterior sampling and hypothesis testing under uncertainty. 

I am **actively seeking Summer 2026 Research Internship opportunities**, especially those at the intersection of  **generative AI and reinforcement learning**.  If my background aligns with your team’s focus, I would love to connect!  📧 *Feel free to reach out via email {tianyuchen@utexas.edu}.*
