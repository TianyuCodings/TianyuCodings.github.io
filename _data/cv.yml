        - Developed an object-centric vision-language model (VLM) agent that automates fine-grained, multi-turn image-editing evaluation, eliminating reliance on human annotators for benchmark construction. The project received <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jlVDWl7wJ8SGFcGdRG7wGA">media coverage in well-known Chinese outlets</a> and is showcased on the <a href="https://tianyucodings.github.io/EdiVAL-page/">project website</a>.
        - Led large language model (LLM) post-training research on mathematical reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge alignment, including recipe design for <b>autoregressive</b> and <b>diffusion-based</b> language models.
